# Footwear Sales Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis of footwear sales data to uncover insights for better business decisions



##  Project Overview
This project analyzes a Footwear Sales dataset to uncover insights that can help a footwear company make better data-driven decisions.  
The goal is to understand sales trends, find patterns in product categories and sales performance, identify outliers, and suggest ways the company can optimize its sales strategy.



##  Data Used
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Footwear Sales Dataset](http://kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahlahaji/footware-sales-dataset)
- **Format:** CSV



## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn



##  Objectives
1. Describe and clean the sales data for accuracy and consistency  
2. Visualize key features to understand how product categories affect sales performance  
3. Explore correlations between variables that could impact revenue  
4. Detect and handle outliers that could skew business decisions  
5. Provide actionable recommendations to help the company improve sales forecasting and performance



## What I Did
- Imported and inspected the raw dataset
- Performed data cleaning (checked for missing or inconsistent values)
- Created box plots and violin plots to compare sales performance across product categories
- Explored pairwise correlations between sales drivers
- Detected and handled outliers using statistical methods
- Summarized insights for potential business action



##  Key Findings
- Sales performance varies significantly across product categories
- Certain product segments show higher sales variability, highlighting opportunities to optimize stock or marketing focus
- Outliers in sales volumes were identified and treated to improve forecasting reliability
